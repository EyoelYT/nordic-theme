# Nordic Night Theme

A darker, higher-contrast spin on the lovely [Nord color palette](https://nordtheme.com) and its corresponding [theme for Emacs](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs).

There's a place holder repo [on GitHub](https://github.com/ashton314/nordic-night) if you like starring things.

# Description

I really like the [Nord](https://nordtheme.com) color paletteâ€”I think the colors gel together really well. However, I never liked how low-contrast the background and body text were.

This is my personal twist on the Nord theme for Emacs: this has a darker background and uses a wider range of the color pallet in general code. Generally this makes Emacs a little more colorful and higher-contrast with the background without being too in-your-face about it. It's supposed to feel gentle and easy to read. Some of the major modifications include:

 - Background is much darker at `#121212`.
 - Many of the `font-lock-*-face` variables have been customized to use colors other than shades of blue.
 - No light-theme support.

I'll add some screenshots as I go along. Please feel free to [send any suggestions](https://todo.sr.ht/~ashton314/nordic-night) you may have, though bear in mind this is a hobby project.
