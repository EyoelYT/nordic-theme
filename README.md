# Nordic Night Theme

A darker, higher-contrast spin on the lovely [Nord](https://nordtheme.com) [theme for Emacs](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs).

# Description

This is my personal twist on the Nord theme for Emacs: this has a darker background and uses a wider range of the color pallet in general code.

# Screenshots

Coming soon.
